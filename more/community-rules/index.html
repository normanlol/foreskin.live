                        Do not use any of our services to spam or advertise. You <i>can</i> advertise in the Discord server, however, do not join to 
                        exclusively do that.

                <p>
                    Ban appeals are available as well, but may not be available depending the severity of the violation.<br>
                    Because of this, you will only be given a ban link <i>if</i> we feel you deserve a second chance.
