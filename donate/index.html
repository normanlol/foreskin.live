                <p>We keep our services free-of-charge because we believe you shouldn't have to pay (via money or having us sell your data) for basic services.</p>
                <p>
                    That being said, this site isn't free to <i>run</i>. Although some of our resources are generously provided to us for free, we'd love to keep expanding
                    it to be better and to add more services <i>to</i> foreskin.live.Things such as getting domains or using VPSs aren't exactly the cheapest to get.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>However</b>, please do not feel obligated to donate. As we said earlier, we would like to keep our services 100% free. Once you donate, we can add
                    your name to the <a href="/team">"Our Team" page</a> if you'd like (specify in the donation note).
                </p>
                <p>Money that's donated goes <i>directly</i> to Foreskin.live's owner and will help fund future or current projects.</p>
